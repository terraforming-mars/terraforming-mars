This is an open-source online implementation of the great board game Terraforming mars. **It is not affiliated
with FryxGames, Asmodee Digital or Steam in any way.**

**Note**: This project has no affiliation with "Rebalanced Mars", whose authors have refused to open-source their code.
We believe this is both a violation of our GPL3 license, and also of the spirit of collaboration that this project tries
to foster. Note that any new features you see on this repo made available on that server are without our permission.

**Buy The Board Game**

The board game is great and this repository highly recommends [purchasing it](https://www.amazon.com/Stronghold-Games-6005SG-Terraforming-Board/dp/B01GSYA4K2) for personal use.

## ⬤ I want to join the community!
[Join us over on Discord!](https://discord.gg/afeyggbN6Y).

## ⬤ I want to play!
There's a instance available at https://terraforming-mars.herokuapp.com/. It's generally reliable, but read more below.

There's also this excellent
[YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCGE78n9vCqhhmRe9YCrRh2GLNMPB_3j1) focused on tutorials custom for this app.

NOTE: This site is restarted daily. A multiplayer game will remain available for 15 days, after which it will be flushed from the database.
Unfinished solo games are flushed after one day. We continue to make stability and scalability improvements in step with growth and popularity,
but to make sure your game remains, we highly recommended to host your own web server.

## ⬤ I want to learn how to play
There are far too many good tutorials online. [Here are the rulebooks, though.](https://github.com/terraforming-mars/terraforming-mars/wiki/Rulebooks)

## ⬤ I want to run a copy of the server locally
Check out our [Local setup wiki page](https://github.com/bafolts/terraforming-mars/wiki/Local-Setup)

Honestly, it's really simple.

## ⬤ I want to run a copy of the server on Heroku
Check out our [Heroku setup wiki page](https://github.com/bafolts/terraforming-mars/wiki/Heroku-Setup)

(As of 2022-11-28, Heroku no longer has a free tier. However, it is still our recommended way to deploy,
as they're the clearest instructions.)

## ⬤ I want to run a copy of the server on Docker
Check out our [Docker setup wiki page](https://github.com/bafolts/terraforming-mars/wiki/Docker-Setup)

(Warning, this is not aggressively supported, though some people are on the Discord.)

## ⬤ I want to run a copy on a YunoHost server
[![Install Terraforming Mars with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.svg)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=terraforming-mars)

The code for the Yunohost Terraforming-Mars package is in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/terraforming-mars_ynh)

(Warning, this is not specifically supported.)

## ⬤ I want to report a bug or feature request
Add it to our [issues tab](https://github.com/bafolts/terraforming-mars/issues/new).

## ⬤ I want to contribute to development
See [contribution guide](https://github.com/terraforming-mars/terraforming-mars/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [local development setup](https://github.com/terraforming-mars/terraforming-mars/wiki/Local-Setup).

## ⬤ I want to win!
Me too, pal. Me too.
