/**
 * A game store. Load, save, you know the drill.
 *
 * Each game has a unique ID represented belowe as `game_id`. As games proceed,
 * the game is saved at later states. Inidividual saves of a game's state have a
 * unique and growing `save_id`. A game's initial _save point_ is always 0.
 *
 * This API has an asynchronous callback mechanism, so do not expect something
 * like this to work:
 *
 * ```
 * let count = 0;
 * database.getGames((err, allGames) => {
 *  count++;
 * });
 * expect(count).eq(1);
 * ```
 * More at https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-async-programming-in-node-js/
 *
 * Every method's success or failure is derived by the callback. Each callback
 * has an `err` parameter, which, when `undefined`, implies success. An `err`
 * with a defined value represents failure.
 *
 * If a method doesn't have a callback, it's assumed to succeed.
 *
 * Game state is stored as a single JSON string, which is why the `game` parameter is
 * often JSON.
 *
 * Finally, `players` as a number merely represents the number of players
 * in the game. Why, I have no idea, says kberg.
